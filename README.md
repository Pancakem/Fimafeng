Fimafeng is a very simple web server implementation of a subset of HTTP/1.1 written from scratch. Its few features are:

- HTTPS
- Virtual hosting

It is easy to spin up an instance on your machine; see the [usage](#usage) section.

## Install

To start, clone this [repo](https://github.com/Pancakem/Fimafeng)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Pancakem/Fimafeng
cd Fimafeng
```

Fimafeng is written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). It is recommended to [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) with [rustup](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/index.html), a tool that installs and manages different versions of the Rust toolchain. It also installs [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html) by default, which this project uses.

## Usage
To start `Fimafeng`, all that is required is the binary and config file. One only needs to pass in the config file and voila!

```sh
fimafeng path/to/config.yaml
```

## Run tests

Fimafeng only tests its parser. The tests can be run by:

```sh
cargo test
```

## Configuration
Configuring Fimafeng is done with config files written in YAML. Example config files are provided in `/resources`.

### Basic configuration

The address and port to host the server on are specified as `host` and `port` respectively.
The directory to serve files from is specified in `directory`, and the the number of concurrent requests a Fifameng server can handle is specified with `thread_count.`.

```yaml
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 8000
thread_count: 5
directory: 'resources'
```

Directories are relative to the binary's working directory, not the config file's location.

### Templating

Fimafeng displays dynamic HTML pages using the simple text templating language offered by the crate [tinytemplate](https://crates.io/crates/tinytemplate).


### HTTPS

By default, Fimafeng communicates with HTTP over TCP with no encryption or added security. However, TLS can be enabled by specifying the optional `tls` dictionary (with required values):

```yaml
tls:
  cert_path: 'resources/cert.pem'
  key_path: 'resources/key.pem'
```

This is the only optional field in the config, and contains the paths to the TLS certificates and private key files to be used. Note that if TLS is enabled, Fimafeng will no longer serve regular HTTP requests without TLS.

Also, paths are relative to the binary's working directory, not the config file's location.

### Virtual hosting

A naive form of virtual hosting can be done by specifying multiple config files with different `port` values.

```sh
fimafeng example.yaml example1.yaml
```
